        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Neutron, a groundbreaking evolution in digital finance. Unlike anything before
          it, Neutron is not just a cryptocurrency; it is the dawn of a new era in economic freedom.
          Born from the cosmic dust and crafted with the vision of a limitless future, Neutron is
          here to redefine the boundaries of what digital currency can achieve.

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Neutron is more than a financial tool; it is a movement. A movement towards a world where
          financial systems are not shackled by the constraints of traditional banking. It is for
          the pioneers, the dreamers, and the visionaries who believe in a world where money is free
          from the chains of centralization and corruption.

        <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
        <p>
          With a finite supply of 23,000,000 Neutron (NTR), each divisible into 100,000,000 Chip,
          Neutron is engineered to be anti-inflationary and scalable. It is a currency designed for
          real-world utility, ready to power applications across galaxies.
